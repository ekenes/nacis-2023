## Spots and Dots: Building a Modern Web UI for Mapping Density with Gridded Proportional Symbols

In his 1967 book, “Urban Atlas,” Richard Saul Wurman introduced an innovative cartographic style for mapping population density. The style is defined as a grid of concentric circles proportionally sized based on a numeric value. Wurman’s graduate students described this symbology as “spots and dots.” This talk will summarize the engineering process that went into creating a user interface on the web that allows anyone to create a visualization in this style in seconds, thus avoiding a formerly tedious and time-consuming process. We’ll discuss the cartographic value of the style, its strengths and limitations, challenges in implementing it on the web, and how it compares to other forms of density visualizations.
